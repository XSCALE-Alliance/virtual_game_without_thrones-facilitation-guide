like the following paragraph:

> Welcome to this game Wildlings!

Facilitator instruction scripts can be used to read to the players,
but you can of course use your own words if you prefer.

This is how we indicate a ten-minute timebox: [10].

## Starting point

 1. You have [prepared the game](game-preparation.md).
 1. You are aware of the number of participants 
    and have asserted it's in the 6-18 range.

This session plan starts 1 hour in advance of the start time.

## Walk-in and trouble shooting [60]

Open the zoom call 1 hour in advance to help anyone 
who experiences problems in their technical setup.

Verify that ... :

 * the Mural is available and share the public link.
 * the Zoom rooms are setup according to the number of teams and chapters
 * the Minetest server is humming along just fine
 * you can enter the world as your facilitator character
 * you can enter the world as a new character and that you spawn at a sensible spot

While people are joining the call, do a head count 
and verify that you have set up the appropriate Zoom rooms.

<!-- Maybe play some music while waiting? -->

## Session kick-off [10]

Welcome everybody.

<!-- notes for introduction 

Verification questions:

 * who has installed Minetest?
 * who has started Minetest?
 * who has played a bit?

 -->

## A facilitator's introduction [10]

Share your screen, with Minetest in full screen.

Enter the world as your facilitator character.

Read [the game start script] and move through the world accordingly.

Share the session's outline.

## Form the delivery squads [20]

Form the delivery squads.
Place the members of a squad in their dedicated room.

Ask each squad to discuss the following topics, in a ten-minute timebox:

 * briefly introduce everybody in the squad
 * let each team member pick a role
   * there should be at least a Speaker and an Architect
   * each member has exactly one role
   * at least one member per role in a team
 * discuss what a great castle for your customer would look like

Consider using the following script:

> What we'll do now, is form our delivery squads.
> Our delivery squads are organized around our customers.
> In our case, the noble-people we want to house, 
> are the Baratheons, the Boltons, and the Greyjoys.
> 
> In order to create three well balanced teams, 
> I'm going to ask you some questions.
> 
> Based on the group's answers to the questions,
> I'll put you in a delivery squad.
> Each squad will be have its own breakout room.
> Once your squad is complete, 
> introudce yourself, divide the roles, 
> and discuss what a great castle would look like for your squad's customers.
> While you dos that,
> please update the Mural with your name, squad and role.

> Question one: who has played Minetest, Minecraft or a similar game before?

Divide these players across the delivery squads.

> Question two: who has access to the Mural I shared earlier?

Divide these players across the delivery squads.

> Question three: who has seen more than 10 Game of Thrones episodes?

Divide the remaining players randomly amongst the squads.

Start the timebox in Zoom.

Update the names of the players in Zoom with the squad name.
