Thank you for joining me in our King's quest to unite all the houses in the Seven Kingdoms!

We'll start off with building a castle 
where people from all the houses of Westeros can live, 
united under a single roof.

In building this castle, 
there will be no hierarchies, no command and control.
Instead, we will self-organize like Wildlings!
I will show you how in a couple of minutes.

But let me start of by showing you the area our King has chosen for our castle!

_Fly around the area and vaguely show where the castle will be._

I do not have to tell you what a beautiful castle looks like.
You already know - and what you don't know, you can figure out yourself.
By building the castle you will learn what's needed even better.

_Fly back to the building area, to the stream council area._

Now let's look at how we will self-organize to build this castle.

We'll organize in customer-oriented, autonomous squads.
Each squad will build and deliver valuable parts of our castle.
In this stream, we will focus our efforts on the Baratheons, the Boltons and the Greyjoys.
Each of these squads will have a dedicated building area.
As a stream, we will build one castle.
We will align using round councils.

Each squad will have all the necessary skills to build a valuable increment.
All team members are equals. There are no masters, no owners, no managers, no kings.
All team members have the same skills.
However, different chapters focus on different aspects of the castle:

 * Architect
 * Maester
 * Speaker
 * Merchant
 * Artist
 * Captain

_Show the building areas._

We will start building at 7.00. 
We will stop building at sundown, 19.00.

Each squad builds castle features in its own area. 

_To do: explain the entire cycle_

An entire cycle onsists of five activities

 1. Delivery: build new castle features with your squad
 1. Chapter meeting: propose new features and treaties
 1. Two simultaneous activities:
    * Integration: refactor and integrate castle features
    * Small Council: prioritize castle features
 1. Alignment: combine and ratify treaties
