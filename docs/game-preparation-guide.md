Hi,

I'm looking forward to meeting you at our next Online Game Without Thrones!

In this game we'll create a castle to unite the houses of Westeros.
You and your fellow players will self-organize like Wildlings.

There will be no command and control, no hierarchy, no managers, masters or owners. 
But chapter meetings, governance treaties, small councils, 
Leadership as a Service, self-managing streams of self-organizing teams, 
and the wit and wisdom of Wildlings ...

*Date, time and location*

Saturday, July 6th, 13.00 CEST (Amsterdam Time that is!).

Videoconferencing using Zoom, in our dedicated [meeting room].

The address of our Minetest world will be disclosed at the start of the game.

*Please prepare:*

All the tools we use are free for you to download, install and use.

 1. We will play this game online, in a game called [Minestest].
    This is a free and opensource game. 
    Please [download Minetest here] and install it on your computer.
 1. We will use [Zoom.us] for videoconferencing.
    Please [download the Zoom client] and install it.
    We'll use this Zoom [meeting room].
 1. Please verify that you can access [our online whiteboard].
    Bonus points if you can add a virtual sticky with your name to the players area.

You're good to go if:

 * You're connected to the internet with a fairly decent internet connection.
 * You can start the Minetest game.
 * You can start your zoom client and join our meeting room.

*Any problems?*

 * Keep calm, we'll probably figure it out!
 * Reach out to me by replying to this mail.
 * I'll be available one hour in advance to the start of the game in our [meeting room] to help you out. 


I'm looking forward to seeing you next Saturday!

Cheers,


Marijn

## Build landing area

As a player, 
I want a place to spwan 
so that I can joyfully start the game.

 * Set the spawn point to the center of this landing area
 * It is big enough to hold all players
 * It is protected from accidental griefing
 * It has an area for each squad
 * It has an area for each chapter
 * It has an area to hold the council meeting

## Assign creation platforms

As a squad of players, 
I want my own building area,
so that I can build without interference from players outside of my squad.

 * The area is safe
   - players cannot destroy it by accident


## Place artefacts

## Test play

 * Test mods
 * Make sure you have the right privs
   * set time
   * grant/revoke privileges
   * ...
 * Start as a new user and check that you can do the things you need


## Prepare Zoom

In the zoom call, prepare Zoom break out rooms for:

 * the squads
 * the chapters
 * the stream council
