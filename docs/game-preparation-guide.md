Hi,

I'm looking forward to meeting you at our next Online Game Without Thrones!

Goal of this game is to create a castle to unite the houses of Westeros.
You and your fellow players will self-organize like Wildlings.

There will be no command and control, no hierarchy, no managers, masters or owners. 
But chapter meetings, governance treaties, small councils, 
Leadership as a Service, self-managing streams of self-organizing teams, 
and the wit and wisdom of Wildlings ...

*Date, time and location*

Saturday, July 6th, 13.00 CEST (Amsterdam Time that is!).

Videoconferencing using Zoom, in our dedicated [meeting room].

*Please prepare:*

All the tools we use are free for you to download, install and use.

 1. We will play this game online, in a game called [Minestest].
    This is a free and opensource game. 
    Please [download Minetest here] and install it on your computer.
 1. We will use [Zoom.us] for videoconferencing.
    Please [download the Zoom client] and install it.
    We'll use the this Zoom [meeting room].
 1. Please verify that you can access [our online whiteboard].
    Bonus points if you can add a virtual sticky with your name to the players area.

You're good to go if:

 * You're connected to the internet with a fairly decent internet connection.
 * You can start the Minetest game.
 * You can start your zoom client and join our meeting room.

*Any problems?*

 * Keep calm, we'll probably figure it out!
 * Reach out to me by replying to this mail.
 * I'll be available one hour in advance to the start of the game in our [meting room] to help you out. 


I'm looking forward to seeing you next Saturday!

Cheers,


Marijn
